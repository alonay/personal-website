      <h1>From Sales to Rails: About Me</h1>
      <p className= "BioWords"> I am a full stack Software Engineer with a passion for communicating the power of technology through projects and presentations. After grauating Franklin and Marshall College,
      I had two strong years in sales at a fast-paced tech startup. I have always loved technology,
      and was fascinated with the ability of the small tech team at the startup to work with me to build solutions
      that lead to revenue. I wanted to be a superhero too.
      I was accepted into a highly competitive New York City Coding Bootcamp and
      Suddenly a whole world of possibilities opened up and all limitations were gone.
      I use my sales skills and coding skills every day to delight audiences and overcome challenges.</p>
